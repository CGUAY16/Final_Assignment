# Final_Assignment
First Game Project/ very basic Rendition of space invaders

This was a final project I made for my developing mobile apps course back in college. I decided to make a very simple game since making a simple app to place on the google play was
the goal of the final project. I amde a game and he was impressed since I was the only one to do so with that little amount of time (about a months time during the final exams.) 

I used Android studio to make the game since this is the software we were using for the course. The game was made using XML and Java.
